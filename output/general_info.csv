35,Sean,Martin,"Mr. Sean Martin is a Co-Founder and serves as the Chief Technology Officer & Board Member at Cambridge Semantics. He has been on the leading edge of Internet technology innovation since the early nineties. His greatest strength has been the identification and pioneering of next generation software & networking technologies and techniques. Prior to founding Cambridge Semantics he spent fifteen years with IBM Corporation where he was a founder and the technology visionary for the IBM Advanced Internet Technology group. Sean has an astonishing number of Internet ""firsts"" to his credit. These include inventing and implementing both IBM's first Web application server and content-manager, WOM, along with its distributed Web application hosting environment, the Womplex, not to mention a number of other important web site scaling technologies. Sean was responsible for bringing numerous sporting events live to the Web for the first time. This began with Wimbledon, the PGA Championship and the US Open (both golf and tennis) in 1995 and continued through to the extremely highly trafficed 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta where he also launched one of the Internet's first commercial applications, selling event tickets. Sean co-founded IBM's Extreme Blue recruiting program in 1999. In another first, Sean led the invention and implementation of IBM's Sash Weblication Manager, a full-featured client-side HTML & JavaScript runtime with a full IDE that anticipated by five years the current Web 2.0 and Ajax movement and also runtime products like Google Gears, Mozilla Prism and Adobe's Air. Sean was a pioneer in defining SOA. It was under his direction that Sash included IBM's first ever Web Service SOAP & XML-RPC client stacks and associated developer tooling. He also led the first effort to use XMPP (then the Jabber protocol) for asynchronous web services. Sean has represented IBM at the OMG Life Sciences Research group, the Interoperable Informatics Infrastructure Consortium (I3C) and also on the W3C's Semantic Web in Health Care and Life Sciences group. During his time at IBM, Sean was honored with many awards including IBM's Outstanding Technical Innovation award, the Chairman's Award, the IBM Corporation International Star Award, IBM Europe's Technical Excellence award, IBM's Outstanding Technical Achievement award, as well as a special award for rescuing the Web site of the thrilling Kasparov vs. Deep Blue chess match by scaling it to handle the unexpected and unprecedented millions of visitors. Over the past ten years Sean has become increasingly interested in the application of semantic technology standards in enterprise software. He realized that semantic technologies not only offered fresh approaches to solving problems that he had previously found extremely difficult, but they also presented the opportunity to pioneer solutions that have never before been attempted. In his last project at IBM, Sean directed the design and open-source implementation of theIBM Semantic Layered Research Platform, including the Boca RDF store, a complete re-think of traditional middleware through the use of semantic technologies. His move from IBM to found Cambridge Semantics Inc. in 2007 is a huge vote of confidence that the time for semantically aware applications has arrived. Sean has written numerous patents and has authored a number of peer reviewed Life Sciences journal articles. He is a native of South Africa, has lived for extended periods in London, England and Edinburgh, Scotland, but now makes his home in Boston, MA.","Co-Founder, Chief Technology Officer & Board Member",Male,,sean.martin@cambridgesemantics.com,+1 (617) 245-0517,http://linkedin.com/in/seanjmartin,"['1 Beacon Street', '15th Floor', 'Boston, MA 02108', 'United States']"
